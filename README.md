# Root Cause Analysis Model

This project is a deep learning-based model designed to identify the root cause of errors or problems in a dataset. The model utilizes a neural network architecture built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify potential root causes based on input features.

## Key Features
***
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatic scaling and encoding of input data for optimal model performance.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: A sequential model with multiple hidden layers, designed to handle complex patterns in the data.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes model training with hyperparameter tuning, accuracy tracking, and evaluation on a test dataset.
- **Root Cause Prediction**: The model can predict the root cause of a given input and return it in a human-readable format.

## Getting Started
1. **Load Data**: The dataset is loaded directly from a URL or can be replaced with your own data.
2. **Train the Model**: Run the provided script to train the model on your dataset.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict root causes for new inputs.

## Usage
This model can be integrated into larger systems to automate the process of root cause analysis, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently.
